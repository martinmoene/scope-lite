## Example usage

```Cpp
#include "nonstd/scope.hpp"

using namespace nonstd;

int count = 0;

namespace on { void exit() { ++count; } }

int main()
{
    { auto guard = make_scope_exit(  on::exit ); } // note: on::exit w/o &
    { auto guard = make_scope_exit( &on::exit ); } // note: &on::exit

    return count;
}
```

Note: do not let stdlib's [global function `on_exit()`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/on_exit.3.html) bite you. Thanks to [Björn Fahller](https://github.com/rollbear).

### Compile and run

```Text
$ g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -I../include -o 01-basic 01-basic.cpp && ./01-basic || echo $?

```

## In a nutshell

**scope lite** is a single-file header-only library to provide [C++ standard libraries extensions, version 3](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/lib_extensions_3) for use with C++98 and later. If available, the standard library is used, unless [configured](#configuration) otherwise.

**Features and properties of scope lite** are ease of installation (single header), freedom of dependencies other than the standard library. With C++20, scope guards can be `constexpr`. This is a configurable extension with respect to the proposal's specification.

**Limitations of scope lite** are ... .

## License

*scope lite* is distributed under the [Boost Software License](https://github.com/martinmoene/scope-lite/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).

## Dependencies

*scope lite* has no other dependencies than the [C++ standard library](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header).

## Installation

*scope lite* is a single-file header-only library. Put `scope.hpp` in the [include](include) folder directly into the project source tree or somewhere reachable from your project.

## Synopsis

**Contents**  
[Documentation of C++ standard libraries extensions, version 3](#documentation-of-c-standard-libraries-extensions-version-3)  
[Non-standard extensions](#non-standard-extensions)  
[Configuration](#configuration)  

### Documentation of C++ standard libraries extensions, version 3

Depending on the compiler and C++ standard used, *scope lite* behaves less or more like the standard's version. To get an idea of the capabilities of *scope lite* with your configuration, look at the output of the [tests](test/scope.t.cpp), issuing `scope-main.t --pass @`. For the standard's documentation, see [C++ standard libraries extensions, version 3](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/lib_extensions_3).  

### Non-standard extensions

#### constexpr scope guards

With C++20, scope guards can be `constexpr`. This is a configurable extension with respect to the proposal's specification, see section Configuration, [Disable constexpr extension](#disable-constexpr-extension).

Here is an [example](https://godbolt.org/z/63GWaaG3h) of `constexpr` scope guards on Compiler Explorer.

### Configuration

#### Tweak header

If the compiler supports [`__has_include()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/preprocessor/include), *scope lite* supports the [tweak header](https://vector-of-bool.github.io/2020/10/04/lib-configuration.html) mechanism. Provide your *tweak header* as `nonstd/scope.tweak.hpp` in a folder in the include-search-path. In the tweak header, provide definitions as documented below, like `#define scope_CPLUSPLUS 201103L`.

#### Standard selection macro

\-D<b>scope\_CPLUSPLUS</b>=199711L  
Define this macro to override the auto-detection of the supported C++ standard, if your compiler does not set the `__cplusplus` macro correctly.

#### Select standard library version or *scope lite*

At default, *scope lite* uses the standard library's version if it is available and lets you use it via namespace `nonstd`. You can however override this default and explicitly request to use the standard's version or *scope lite*'s header via the following macros.

-D<b>scope\_CONFIG\_SELECT\_SCOPE</b>=scope_SCOPE_DEFAULT  
Define this to `scope_SCOPE_STD` to select standard's version. Define this to `scope_SCOPE_NONSTD` to select *scope lite*. Default is undefined, which has the same effect as defining to `scope_SCOPE_DEFAULT`.

#### Disable extensions

-D<b>scope\_CONFIG\_NO\_EXTENSIONS</b>=0  
Define this to 1 if you want to compile without extensions. Default is undefined.

#### Disable constexpr extension

-D<b>scope\_CONFIG\_NO\_CONSTEXPR</b>=0  
Define this to 1 if you want to adhere to [C++ standard libraries extensions, version 3](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/lib_extensions_3) and not use `constexpr` scope guards. Default is undefined.

## Appendix

The [test program](test/scope.t.cpp) provides information on the compiler, the C++ language and library capabilities and the tests performed.

### A.1 Compile-time information

The version of *scope lite* is available via tag `[.version]`. The following tags are available for information on the compiler and on the C++ standard library used: `[.compiler]`, `[.stdc++]`, `[.stdlanguage]` and `[.stdlibrary]`.
